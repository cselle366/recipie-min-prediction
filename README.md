# Predicting Cooking Time Based on Different Recipie Features 
## By: Annice Chang and Courtney Selle
### Introduction 
We chose to explore the Recipies and Ratings data set from Food.com, which contains thousands of recipies and all of the data pertaining to the recipies. As students, we prioritize cooking time when it comes to our meals, so we were particularly interested in what factors affect the amount of time a recipie takes to make. Our central question is as follows: 
> How accurately can we predict a recipie's cooking time based on its ingridients, steps, and nutritional content?

This question is valuble for both meal planning and time management, and can also help users find recipies based upon preferred cooking time. The dataset contains 731,927 rows and relevant columns to our study include: minutes, nutrition, n_steps, and n_ingridients. We utilized these columns in order to transform the data into individual features such as calories, protein, and sugars. By building this predictive model, we strive to capture the complexity of real world recipies and really investigate the factors affecting cooking time.
